# VGV Coffee App
This application only implements the first feature of getting a random coffee image due to my time constraints.

The layered architecture is as follows:
- `presentation` - The presentation layer.
- `data` - The data layer.
- `domain` - The domain layer.

Tests are organized in the same manner as the architecture.

## TODO
- Add the second feature of saving the image to the phone. I would have used a community package in this instance.

## Running The Application
Run these from the root directory of the project.
```bash
flutter run
```
## Running The Tests
```bash
flutter test
```
